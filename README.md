# DragonbaneCharacterSheetGenerator

This is a project to create a (primarily) Windows app to fill in a fillable PDF for the Dragonbane TTRPG.

The intended functionality is that you get to select things like Kin, Profession, ect. en to have the information automatically filled in the sheet.
I intend to use a third-party sheet, which can also hold the information on Heroic abilities, spells ect.

The stats are to be filled, not rolled.
Maybe a later itteration will also have this functionallity.

The primary function is for my own player, to get a good, readable sheet with as much info as possible.
