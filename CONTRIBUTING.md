# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute!

Key rules (enforced):

- Never commit directly to `main`. Use a feature branch and open a pull request.
- Branch naming: use `feat/<short-desc>`, `fix/<short-desc>`, `chore/<short-desc>`, etc.
- Open a PR targeting `main` from your feature branch and include a clear description.
- The repository uses CODEOWNERS. PRs that change code require review/approval from the code owner(s).
- Do not merge your own PRs unless explicitly authorised by the repository owner.
- Keep PRs focused and small; link to issues where possible.
- Make sure any manual steps to run the app are documented in README.

Suggested workflow:

1. Fork or branch off main in this repo.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
3. Make changes, run any local checks.
4. Push your branch and open a PR.
5. Request review from @BasTrebus (code owner) and address comments.
6. Once approved and CI is green, maintainers will merge.

If you need help, open an issue describing the change or ping @BasTrebus.
