🤝 Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is open source and community-driven. To keep everything safe and respectful of Free League Publishing’s rights, please follow these rules:

✅ Do
- Contribute code (features, bug fixes, refactoring, tests).  
- Add generic templates (e.g., JSON structures for monsters, spells, items) without filling in copyrighted text.  
- Write documentation that explains how to use the app, or how to extend it.  
- Reference the Dragonbane Core Rulebook by page number or section when needed.  
- Use the official “Third-Party Supplement” logo if appropriate, but not the Dragonbane logo.  

🚫 Don’t
- Copy or paste rulebook text, lore, or artwork into the repository.  
- Upload pre-filled monster stats, spell descriptions, or adventures from the official books.  
- Use Free League’s logos or trademarks (other than the approved third-party logo).  
- Create a fork that tries to replace the need for the official rulebook.
